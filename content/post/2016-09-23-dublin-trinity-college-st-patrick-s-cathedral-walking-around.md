People get to live here.

I hopped on a train from Belfast to Dublin Tuesday night after work. After a two-hour ride in the comfy and high-tech vehicle, I emerged from Dublin Connolly station and hailed a cab to my Airbnb. 
Dublin is the real deal in terms of city life i.e. there were partiers and people walking around and stores still open at 11pm. I immediately noticed that there are a larger number of dramatically different and stronger accents here.

My cab driver about his trip to Cancun: "Woiled"

Me: "Oiled?!"

Him: "No, woiled!" 

Me: "World!"

Him: "No, woiled!"

Me: "Oh, WILD!" 

Got it.  
I had to wait until the next morning to admire Dublin in its beautiful and mind-blowingly typical European glory. At this point I am having major city envy.

Dublin Castle, where the UK administration of the government was and what is now an Ireland government building. Suddenly, my next job goal is to work in a castle.

The post office.

The bank (past the construction and double decker bus).

Lemme just withdraw some money from this *balustraded columned palace*. Fun fact: Even though the bank is a huge building, it has no windows. When it was built, there was a window tax! 

I first visited Trinity College. It so happened to be "freshers week" so all the clubs were out tabling (ahh memories). The student tour guide mentioned how crazy it was at the time but honestly it was nothing compared to Berkeley on any given day (arguably the most important skill a Berkeley education equips you with is the ability to walk through masses of flyers in your face, crazy homeless people, and students protesting without blinking an eye).

Obligatory college frisbee dude.

I loved hearing about Trinity from a student's perspective. Fun facts: 

* Their graduation ceremony is conducted in Latin. So no one knows what the hell is being said for two hours, and then you go party. 
* Graduates are called up in order of their performance, first being the best student. Pressure, much?!
* During one's second year one has the option to take the "schols," an extremely difficult series of possibly ten tests based on one's major. However, the 30 or so students that manage to pass each year get free everything: tuition, room and board on campus (most students live off campus), and a yearly stipend.

This now non-denominational chapel often hosts weddings. The catch: both the bride and groom have to be Trinity graduates. No two-fors here, folks.

A dorm. The big doors lead to the showers. The catch: there are no internal entrances to the showers! So imagine towel-clad students dashing outside in the winter.

There are ten or so of these [*Sphere Within Sphere*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_Within_Sphere) sculptures throughout the world, apparently including one at Berkeley (after some googling and brain-racking I think it's at the Oxford & Center St path opening, friends).

The most popular attraction at Trinity is [The Book of Kells](https://www.tcd.ie/visitors/book-of-kells/), basically the Bible. It is in this library, of which the bottom layer looks different because those arches actually used to be open, essentially to act as stilts for the building to protect the precious documents inside. Now they have these big trees imported from Oregon to help with drainage.

The Book of Kells is published on vellum, or calf skin. 185 cows' worth, to be precise. No photos were allowed.

In the Long Room, the high-ceilinged floor above The Book of Kells, books are ordered not by alphabet (how silly) but by size.

*The* harp.

Boobs. Tourists are pervs.

I made my way to St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Author Jonathan Swift is buried here. I don't know Gulliver's Travels, but it was a kick reading [A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal) in college.

Our free walking tour guide Patrick conceded that the sculpture does nothing. It is, in the end, a €4 million homing device for drunk people.

The real St. Stephen's Green, a lovely park that is so not the Irish pub in Mountain View.

A now seasoned tourist of Europe, I whipped out my umbrella when it started pouring in the evening. Nevertheless, the water began to soak through my shoes and I clambered onto a bus for a damp ride home after a full happy day of sightseeing.
