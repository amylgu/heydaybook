Good morning. 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-09-24-guinness-whiskey-croke/01_morning_beer.jpg' width='350'></p>

I stacked the tours my second day in Dublin. Since it's normal to drink at 10am, I headed first to [Guinness Storehouse](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en), the most popular attraction in Ireland. 

A lot of people may consider it a tourist trap, but even though there was not so much meat to the museum, just eye-catching labels and short video clips on every floor, it was a refreshing break from serious historical exhibits and I wholeheartedly enjoyed my visit. It was wonderfully dramatic.

All hail Arthur Guinness. I did learn that he and his wife had 21 children. Wowza. Unfortunately, given the typical infant mortality rate of the times, only 10 survived.

"It's nourishing properties."

Don't worry, that drink up there wasn't on an empty stomach. Baby beer!

Even if you don't love beer, the Gravity Bar on the top floor of the museum gives probably the best view of Dublin.

After downing a pint of Guinness, I naturally beelined for the nearby [Teeling Whiskey Distillery](https://teelingwhiskey.com/).
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-09-24-guinness-whiskey-croke/07_teeling_distillery.jpg' width='350'></p>

Teeling is the only company that still distills their whiskey inside the city of Dublin.

They have three copper stills--named Allison, Natalie, and Rebecca, after the founder's daughters--that boil down what starts out as essentially beer into more potent alcohol.  Since alcohol has a lower boiling point than water, as long as they keep the temperature at 99Â°C, water won't come up with and dilute the alcohol vapor. The liquid starts from beer-level ABV, goes to 20% ABV after Allison, and so on.

That safe with the glass bowls represents how they used to check alcohol content. The only person who could open it was the tax man. Taxes were proportional to how alcoholic your product was: The tax man would swing by and drop gunpowder into the alcohol, and if it went up in flames, you would have to pay higher taxes. 

The stuff in this giant wooden fermenter was swirling fast, even though there is no stirring machinery in there. Powered purely by yeast!

While Teeling distills their whiskey within the city limits, they are not allowed to keep the resulting liquid in their facility for the 6+ year maturation process, so they ship it up north a ways. Something about having a zillion casks of an extremely flammable substance in a residential neighborhood.

Having been adequately nourished by the beer and whiskey tastings and pressed for time, I took a cab to my next stop, Croke Park Stadium.
![](/post/2016-09-24-guinness-whiskey-croke/13_croke_park.jpg)

The tour turned out to be less of an explanation of the brutal-looking national sports of [Gaelic football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football) and [hurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling) than geared towards people who were already fans, as they showed us the dressing rooms and lounges for the players, the luxury box seats, etc. They do have a small Gaelic Athletic Association museum, but my overambitious self did not leave much time to linger after the tour. 

I thought it interesting that the jerseys are not different for football and hurling, just indicative of county. Wish I could see a match!

The top levels of the stadium also provided scenic views of the city, and the cold winds made for a helpful sobering walk, enough so that I could book it on [Dublinbikes](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/) to my next destination!

Another city, another [jail](/2016/09/titanic-belfast-crumlin-road-gaol-ulster-museum/). Kilmainham Gaol is notable because it housed and saw the executions of numerous leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. I noted that its panopticon structure is similar to that of the Crum.

<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-09-24-guinness-whiskey-croke/19_jail_style2.jpg' width='350'></p>

The executions of the major figures of the Easter Rising happened in this windowless yard.

However, public hangings happened right out on the street. Those two little squares on top fill in what used to be holes for hanging poles. Scary. 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-09-24-guinness-whiskey-croke/21_public_hanging_spot.jpg' width='350'></p>

After the tour, I was about as hangry as someone who had fueled with only beer and whiskey since breakfast, so sat outside and relished a gas station dinner of a sandwich and Tayto crisps (<- look) before biking back to the city centre (<- loook). 

Tangent: How awesome is the Tayto man? He makes me smile every time.
