If you google "Barcelona," Park Guell is what you see.

Are you tired of Gaudi yet?! Because I will never be.

Park Guell is a large scenic space situated high above the city, requiring a steep climb from the closest metro station. There is a sizable free section with trails.

There was a relatively small fee of â‚¬7 to go into the Monumental Zone including the terrace, mosaics, and buildings underneath.

The animals love it too! This sprinkler was bubbling and turns out that makes for the perfect pigeon water fountain :)

Just a big beautiful playground.

It's difficult to come back to real life after being in Gaudi-land, but once I ogled my way through the entire park I clambered back downhill and took the metro back to El Gotic. 

The metro, unfortunately, is quite the sobering place. Another tip if you visit Barcelona: *hold your sh\*t*. The pickpocket threat is real, especially in the subway. On the tour the first day, our guide literally pulled a lady's bag out of the hands of a sneaky mother-daughter duo down there. If you look for it, you'll see many a distracted tourist and even native just looking the other way become victims. 

But Barna's charms far outweigh the cons of typical big city life. Before coming, when I thought of Barcelona I thought of tapas, sangria, cool buildings, etc. But the most awesome thing I had *no idea* about were the human pyramids.

YOU GUYS. This is such a big deal.

I love it.

It goes way back.

As you can see, there are different components to the human tower. It starts with a large base of people who push in, to support the climbers. The top person should be small and light, and is thus usually a child. 

This isn't just a cool sculpture...

It commemorates the tallest human pyramid to date! Twelve layers of people. *Twelve layers of peeople.*

My blog just peaked. 

Just kidding keep reading! Time to journey to the French seaside B) Ooh la la...
