The murals of Belfast were bringing out all the stops on my last day and I wanted to shred my plane ticket.

Conclusions are always the most painful to write. Let's begin with a photo dump from the last 1.5 weeks of the trip: 

(Close to) midnight in Paris. French to the max.

Graffiti that made me smile. Monsieur Chat!

And Totoro made it overseas too! Comforting to see.

My Airbnb was in the artsy [St. Germain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s) neighborhood. Russian dolls are so fun! Do you see how small they get?! It's amazing that each one has a different painting on it.

Awesome sculpture. At least, I hope, a sculpture...

Okay this one is not so much reminiscence but a PSA that Charles De Gaulle airport is a NIGHTMARE OF TUBES.

If you emerge victorious, you then enter the Extremely Long Escalator of Artless Boredom.

I'm probably just a little bitter because I had to go through the entire process twice, after my flight got cancelled. CDG had regular security but also an additional immigration check that I had never encountered before with one very long and slow line. 

Giggles win over grumpiness upon finally arriving in Dublin.

Vibrant iPad art at [The MAC](https://themaclive.com/)! Touristing up until the last minute.

Baked some all-American goods for the office. \*Without\* any measuring cups or devices even if I do say so myself. Grams shrams.

Behold no less than 10 lbs of candy. Priorities.

My first regret from my adventure was not capturing the sunny, sheep-dotted, is-this-really-not-photoshopped-GREEN fields upon initially descending into Belfast. Because I was literally frozen in awe. So here's a shot (yes yes rainbow!) from my flight out, though on a drizzly morning. But perhaps that's more appropriate :)

Now I'm home and just a tad heartbroken about it. To the friends--old, new, foreign, and domestic--who made it impossible to feel lonely, you are precious. Please visit me right away.

Now to scour the internet for cheap flights...
