The second famous building by Gaudi in the Eixample a couple blocks down from [Illa de la Discordia](/2016/10/hola-barcelona-introducing-the-genius-gaudi/) is Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera.

La Pedrera is like one big ocean wave, and the balconies reminded me of seaweed.

A peek of that whimsical rooftop was too intriguing, so I bought a ticket to go check the apartment building out!

One of the many reasons to love Barcelona is that it's not afraid of a little color!

Can you believe people still live here? Aside from the tourists milling about, how awesome (and rich do you have to be?!)!

Okay I've dawdled enough--here it is:

Like a dream! I think my average heart rate was higher in Barcelona.

It should be known that George Lucas visited La Pedrera before creating Star Wars. See any familiar faces out there hmm?

And a good view, too. Those couches and furniture down there gave me a Sims flashback. Except the people didn't pee themselves and then sob into their hands. Wait that didn't happen to you too?

Down one floor, into the attic. These arches are what gives the rooftop its bumpiness.

In the attic, they had exhibits on the natural elements including a snake skeleton and fossils that inspired Gaudi as well as models of other buildings and replicas of furniture he designed. My favorite were the doorknobs, which could be seen in action in the apartment units down one more level. 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-10-la-pedrera-barri/14_pedrera_knob.jpg' width='250'> <img src='/post/2016-10-10-la-pedrera-barri/15_pedrera_knob2.jpg' width='300'></p>
The knobs were made basically by squishing a piece of metal in one's hand, so they are perfectly ergonomic--or, natural. 

The apartments themselves were fairly standard old-fashioned lavish apartments, but with a Gaudi flair.

It's hard to decide if you had to choose just one between Casa Batllo and La Pedrera; our tour guide recommended La Pedrera for being more classically Gaudi. But from reading it sounds like Casa Batllo is even more colorful so it's still on my checklist!

I've focused on Gaudi, but I think what is amazing about Barcelona's architecture is that even "normal" buildings are eye-catching.

And keep in mind that the Eixample is completely different than the Gothic Quarter, the old city and center of Barcelona.

If you've noticed the flags in this post and the previous one, you might've observed that they are mostly the [estelada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelada), not that of Spain.

Like other diverse territories with long histories, there are groups that want Catalonia to be completely independent, and groups in opposition. If you go to Barcelona:

* Do not say that Catalan is a dialect of Spanish, or that it sounds like Spanish with a French twist. It is its own language, and don't you forget it.
* Of course, just nod along and smile if the conversation turns political, whether the person be separatist or otherwise.

And if these photos are giving you sympathy neck pain, it's because the streets are narrow and the buildings tall! I felt like you could reach across the path from one apartment to the other.

Supposedly Gaudi came to this square for inspiration. The damage is from the Spanish Civil War. This war is not documented in any museum, but similar damage on numerous buildings throughout the city serves as a reminder.

Barcelona has plenty of your typical gorgeous Gothic cathedrals, too.

But, so much more. Here we go again. Palau de la Musica Catalana, the music hall.

[Trencadis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trencad%C3%ADs) is a signature Catalan tiling style, done by smashing ceramic and then putting together the pieces.

Here's a fun fact: The **Eiffel Tower** was originally offered to Barcelona! But...they rejected it.

What stands in its place is this cultural center. Womp womp.  

On the bright side, Barcelona as it is is puh-retty dang cool. Coming up, the most iconic view of the city!
