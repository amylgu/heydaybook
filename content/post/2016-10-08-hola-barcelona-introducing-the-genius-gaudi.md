I know I rave about the architecture of most cities I've visited, but to be truthful I don't think anyone can top Barcelona.
{{< figure src="/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/02_sagrada_familia2.jpg" >}}

Just browsing photos makes me catch my breath, like when I emerged from a metro station, turned around, and saw Sagrada Familia. 130+ years in the making, and still building.

While the angularity and symmetry of traditional Gothic cathedrals are beautiful, what makes Sagrada Familia so astonishing and refreshing is that it aims to be a continuation of nature.

There's a sheep near the top.

You can see vegetation or leafy patterns everywhere, in the texture of the walls to the foliage surrounding the doors to this World Heritage Site.

Antoni Gaudi, the mastermind behind this and basically the entire city, wanted Sagrada Familia to be a forest.  
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/12_sagrada_leaves2.jpg' width='400'></p>

The perfect time to go inside is dusk, when it really feels like the setting sun is streaming light through trees.

Magic.

I liked how the stained glass colors were pure rainbows, to maintain the organic theme.

Curvy staircase.

Add these numbers any way and they sum to 33, Jesus' age when he was crucified in 33 A.D. Actually, the whole building (work of art) with its shape and sculptures is supposed to tell the story of the Bible.

Clearly, the alternative title to this post is "That time I used my entire camera roll on Sagrada Familia." I could walk around the place a hundred times with my jaw dropped because it's so unpredictable, fluid, and innovative.

Unfortunately, Gaudi did not live longer to work on his masterpiece. In 1926 at age 73, he was hit by a car. While he was an accomplished architect, he was not a very public figure so without any sort of identification people did not know who he was; he was transported to a poor hospital and given subpar care. A day or two went by and a priest came along and identified him for the genius he was, but it was too late. However, he is buried in his life's work and his spirit continues to inspire the creation.

They project to finish in 2026. But that final gigantic middle tower that will be 172.5 m tall isn't even built yet, I wonder if they can make it! I definitely want to come back to check on the progress. 

Before receiving big commissions, Gaudi worked on smaller pieces, such as poles and city benches.

The street above is in the spacious Eixample. Barcelona is made up of the old city, and then the Eixample or extension outside of it. You can immediately tell the difference because the former is a labyrinth of narrow streets and the latter a grid. See the difference? 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/22_barcelona_map.png'></p>

Two of Gaudi's most notable constructions are in the Eixample. Here is Casa Batllo. The word following "casa" is usually just the name of the rich family who owned it.

House of bones!
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/24_casa_battlo2.png' width='400'></p>
Gaudi designed Casa Batllo to look like a dragon! The roof is made of colorful scales. The legend of [St. George and the Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon) features him stabbing it in the back, and the turret with the cross represents George's lance. And I presume the bones the contents of the dragon's tummy.

My hostel was nearby, so I often walked past it at night. Spooky!

I can't dismiss the neighboring houses by other modernist architects. Since each designer's style was so different, together they make up the [Illa de la Discordia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illa_de_la_Disc%C3%B2rdia), or the block of discord.  

Casa Batllo is right next to Casa Amatller. Amatller was a chocolatier, and the building still houses a chocolate shop!

And on the corner is Casa Lleo-Morera. Pink marble was the ultimate mark of wealth, so the column featured in the window here is purely a display for the passersby.

The building exteriors mean to tell you something about the residents inside. For example, these sculptures read: we are so rich we have a gramophone and electricity.

The second famous building by Gaudi is a couple blocks down from these, but to avoid making this post a complete photo dump I'll save it for the next one. The suspense! 

Obviously, I was smitten by the architecture, but Barcelona certainly does not lack in nightlife, food, and lively people and I would be remiss to leave out such cultural tidbits.

But numero uno has to be this girl. 
![](/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/31_susan_yay.jpg)
3am dock smiles! Susan was already one of the best, but she is now also the savior. 

Because I called her in a panic three hours before her flight to Barcelona left SFO, after I had killed my phone being my klutz self in London, and she dug up an old one to tide me over. I have an unhealthy amount of luck, but I'll take it. 
![](/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/32_susan_sangria.jpg)
What's dangerously delicious sangria worth if there's no one with whom to share?  

Exhibit 2: Cava. It's Catalonia's champagne, but of course no one's allowed to call it that unless it's really from Champagne, France \*eye roll.\*

Since our friendship is based on food (lesbereal all my relationships are), let's segue into ham.  
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/34_ham.jpg' width='350'></p>
Experience the ham. I may have eaten an entire pig during my stay. Iberico is the good stuff.

Also, a summary of a trip to Spain would not be complete without mention of tapas. Apparently I was too busy drooling to take photos of them--I'm disgraced--but to sum it up the Spanish are champion snackers! There are many different types of tapas, but my favorite were pinchos, which are yummy things on bread.

And remember to keep those sticks, because that's how you pay in the end. 

We took a tapas tour one night, and they introduced this contraption--previously unstained shirt, meet the [porron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porron):
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/37_porron.jpg'></p>
The porron is typically used for festive occasions. And no, you do not pour into a glass but directly into your mouth. If you've got skillz you can straighten your arm while you pour, elongating the stream in mid-air. We had a hoot laughing at one another trying this. Communal wine watering can ftw.  

<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/38_paella1.jpg' width='300'> <img src='/post/2016-10-08-hola-barcelona-introducing/39_paella2.jpg' width='300'></p>
Paella of the normal and squid ink varieties. 

In Spain, dinner starts at 10pm and the parties start at 2am. Go to a restaurant at 7pm or a club at midnight and you're gonna hear crickets. The Spanish are able to pull this off with the glorious invention of the siesta. In the afternoon, shop owners will close their doors and everyone will retreat home for a rest.

In conclusion, I'm coming back to work and proposing afternoon nap time.
