I've had many excellent tour guides in my travels, but the Yeoman Warder at the Tower of London was the highlight of the London trip!

He was very militant, but self-deprecating and hilarious at the same time.

I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't know about the [Yeomen Warders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeomen_Warders) before and thought these were tour guides in costumes, but they are the real deal. There are 37 Yeomen Warders who serve Her Majesty and the Tower of London (the "tower" is really a castle) and live with their families in the castle (which our guide assured us is indeed awesome).

Qualifications include at least 22 years of military service as well as of course no crime, etc. They act as the Queen's bodyguards during public events, among other duties including tour guiding.

They really did have a menagerie of exotic animals including lions back in the day! Because a moat is not enough.

There are still [six resident ravens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravens_of_the_Tower_of_London); superstition has it that they protect the Crown and if they should ever leave the Tower will fall.

Check!

The Crown Jewels are stored in here.

No photography was allowed in the storehouse, but the exhibit was amazing! And by amazing, I mean extremely sparkly. The crowns, some with the classic purple velvet and fluffy white-with-black-specks bottom lining, and gigantic diamonds were outrageous and exactly what is depicted in fairy tales but also real. I enjoyed watching footage of Elizabeth II's coronation ceremony. So much pomp and circumstance. So much gold. 

The Tower of London functioned as a prison too. Many beheadings occurred at the Tower of London, including that of Anne Boleyn. You can see some Yeomen houses in the back there.

I'm a sucker for overly dramatic historical role play. There was an unhappy peasant, soldier, and noble who were trying to invade the castle. You could follow them around and see who succeeded. So fun!

The Tower of London is a very well conducted experience. Definitely go if you are visiting!

Deprived of a functioning subway system at home, I decided to pay a visit to the London Transportation Museum to see how it's done.

Although to complain for just a second--while the Underground is awesome and iconic, the Overground is surprisingly bad. The trains move agonizingly slowly, there doesn't seem to be an established schedule as there is always a hoard of commuters waiting under the board for info on where/when their train will be, and they often are missing drivers so you get stranded at stations. But where did they go?!

Commence the angry exclamations including "bloody"s inserted here and there, which made me smile even though I know I should take these people seriously because they are genuinely angry but it was just so British XD 

Dysfunctional Overground aside, we have a lot to learn from the advanced public transportation systems of Europe. At the start of the museum, the elevator takes you back in time...

I explored the old train cars and saw the beginnings of the Underground, relatively few stations in hazardously stuffy and smoggy tubes.  It was cool seeing familiar station names on the first maps.

You don't say...
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-07-tower-of-london/19_double_deck_quote.png'></p>

My favorite parts of the museum were entire exhibits on all the design aspects, big and small, that make up the system!
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-07-tower-of-london/20_bus_sign.jpg' width='400'></p>
I think the non-digital bus signs give the vehicles a really clean look. They had a video on the long process and care needed to screen print them.

In their own font!

I didn't realize so much thought went into every little aspect of the system. They showed numerous different prototypes for handholds, and miniature room models that designers use to lay out a new station before they actually build it. Not the least is the design of the seat fabric.

Can't have the seats be too clever.

They had old time-y posters.
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-07-tower-of-london/26_old_poster.jpg' width='400'></p>

Perhaps I was inspired by all the Underground themed art in my Airbnb because I bought a pretty poster*!

*Travel tip: Do not buy a poster with two weeks of flying/riding trains/walking around Europe left, they are probably the most simultaneously voluminous and fragile i.e. least portable souvenir ever. This may seem obvious, because it is :(

To wrap up London: First proper fish and chips since being in the UK.

Yay!

I eagerly looked into seeing Harry Potter but alas it is for the truly dedicated. The story unfolds across two plays, so you have to see either matinee + evening in one day, or consecutive evening performances. I suppose I'll take some time to read it, first. But the set-up is fantastic, no?

Everything is better in the homeland. There is so much more to do in London, but it was time to move to warmer climes!
