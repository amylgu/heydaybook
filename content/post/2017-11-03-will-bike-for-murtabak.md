I woke up on the last morning in Singapore with the fact that it was my last chance to get in all the enticing Southeast Asian fusion eats looming over me. 

However, by the time I was up and ready, my grumbling stomach led me to the mall closest to the hostel for breakfast, too hungry to trek any farther to cross a dish off the travel checklist. Inside, I found a small shop that seemed to have a decent number of workers getting their morning meal and newspaper reading in. After the previous day's [toast fiasco](/2017/10/toast-and-the-singaporean-outback/), a big bowl of noodle soup sounded comforting and I ordered a new-to-me dish called mee rebus.

It was weird in that the soup part was thicker than anticipated, but filling. Subpar mall food in Asia is better than subpar mall food in America. I just needed food to get me to my next food stop! I found Dex a floor below at McDonald's; after he was adequately caffeinated, we set out again for [Gardens by the Bay](http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/). 

We stopped at a hawker stand along the way for [nasi lemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_lemak), a traditional Malaysian breakfast featuring fried chicken and anchovies.

When we were about to leave, the older man sitting next to us turned around and told Declan that he needed to eat more. Ha! The Singaporeans were very chatty to us!

We navigated the artificial jungle trails of Gardens by the Bay until we arrived at Cloud Forest. Unfortunately, the second exhibit, Flower Dome, was closed. Cloud Forest is a tall biodome that displays different types of environments on different levels, modulating the temperature and humidity of each level.

Lego flowers. Singapore, even more so than China, seems to embrace and celebrate an aesthetic prizing the manmade. The whole time there I kept questioning whether things were fake or real. Whenever I'm in Asia a lot of things look "tacky," but it's all about perspective. Cultures, amiright?!

A veritable pineapple!

After touring all the rainforests of the world we decided to make our way to the [National Museum of Singapore](http://nationalmuseum.sg/) via [Mobike](https://mobike.com/global/)! Plug: I've used a plethora of bike share services, and the cool things about Mobike is that it doesn't constrain one to fixed bike stations. The bikes can be abandoned and picked up at will, locked and unlocked using the mobile app. Moreover, they happened to be having a "spare the air" type event for citizens that day, so with my Singaporean sim card all my rides were free! I'm looking forward to the day they come to America!

We biked happily along the flat city streets until it started raining. Alas, Mobikes are not built with excellent traction and Declan slipped not a few times! However, we forged on through the inclement weather. While waiting at a stoplight, a random college girl came up to me and offered her umbrella while we stood together. These Singaporeans!

The nice thing about a national museum for a country of such small size and relatively short history is that it is quite a manageable tour. The most interesting aspect of Singapore is its diversity, ethnic and religious, and from the museum exhibits I could see how the many different waves of conquerers that governed the island over the years contributed to its eclectic population today.

Durian break! I had only had frozen durian before this, and the fresh version was quite the spongey stinky pick-me-up. I'm not resolved about my feelings about the fruit.

At the knowledgeable resident Susan's suggestion, we rode all the way from the museum to the Muslim quarter, to a restaurant named Marhaba. They specialize in a fried flatbread of sorts called murtabak. We ordered one filled with meat and egg and YUM.

Best meal of the day, and I daresay the Singapore trip. I have to move on now because my mouth is starting to water just writing about it. 

When Declan picked up a plain oolong tea drink with dinner, the waiter asked him if he was diabetic. Ha! I like that the locals' reaction to getting an unsweetened drink is a concerned "are you sick?" One hard lesson I learned about South Asia is that all the drinks come by default saturated with sugar. Coffee, tea, anything, unless otherwise specified.

Speaking of dranks, our last tourist task was to get the Singapore Sling, available at a historical bar closer to the downtown area. I do appreciate sugar when it comes with alcohol. The bar also offered sacks of complimentary peanuts and shells practically covered the floor.

I never would have thought to explore Singapore as a tourist myself, but I'm glad that friends brought me to that little corner of the globe. The feeling of the country is perhaps encapsulated best by one of its dominant languages, Singlish: a weird fusion of English and Chinese, and short and sweet. Bye I go now!
