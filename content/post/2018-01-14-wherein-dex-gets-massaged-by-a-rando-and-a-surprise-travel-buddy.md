Early the next morning we caught a three-hour-ish flight from Changi to Bangkok. I was more than ready for some dirt and grime and interesting people watching, none of which are prevalent in Singapore. After a fun uber ride which introduced us to the lawless and congested driving culture in Thailand, we made it from the airport to our hostel in the city center.

We plopped our baggage down in our room, savored the AC for a couple minutes, and set out again to explore the bustling streets of Bangkok!

Enjoying street food all the way.

Those noodles were my favorite of the trip!

<br>
It felt so liberating to be one of a zillion in a big city again. Bangkok is so large and free in terms of personal expression that it feels welcoming to all, like one isn't turning heads by being an outsider. 

We made our way to the large central park of the city. Park turtles!

Park iguana! Beats squirrels. It was a large beast. You can possibly make it out in this photo, waggling through the grass.

The iguana was pointed out to us by this friendly man, who claimed to be a massage therapist for professional boxers, a big sport in Thailand. He then proceeded to demonstrate his skills on Declan.

He definitely hit some pressure points, as I saw Declan's finger twitch reflexively when he pushed a certain tendon! It was a pretty great first encounter with a local. 

<br>
Next...Kandarp arrived! It was almost as much of a surprise to me as it might be to you! The Type A planner in me had a mini freakout in trying to get him tickets to the activites planned for the stay...but the more the merrier!

And with Kandarp, comes Google.

The Google Bangkok office was in a luxurious skyscraper, with rather tight elevator security which enhanced the fancy feel.

It was even more knick-knacky and cool than the Mountain View headquarters in my opinion, as if all the token hip decor got concentrated into two floors of a building. 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2018-01-14-wherein-dex-gets/14_gbangkok2.jpg' width='350'></p>
And I did what I always do at Google, which is load up on snacks.

Enjoying the mod office space and moreover cool air at less than 100% humidity.

His happy place.

I didn't want to let a day go by without doing anything touristy, so next we made our way back via BTS and walking to the [Jim Thompson house](http://www.jimthompsonhouse.com/). River walk on the way to the museum:

Jim Thompson was an ex-pat who is largely credited with reviving the silk industry in Thailand. In the late 1960s, he disappeared into a Malaysian forest while vacationing with friends and no one knows what happened to him! Our tour guide made several jokes that made me laugh out loud. I admired the tropical flora and enjoyed imagining what it was like living in the relatively lavish residence decades ago.

One of the highlights of Thailand overall for me were its spunky animals.

In the driveway they had silk demos.

After the tour, I felt due for an AC break and returned to the hostel to rest and plan for a full day's exploration ahead.
