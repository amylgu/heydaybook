Ahh Paris, the city of romance.

a.k.a. The Empire of Death.

[The Catacombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris) are one of the most popular tourist attractions in Paris. This underground ossuary holds the bones of millions, transferred from the city's overflowing cemeteries in the late 1700s. 

WHO NEEDS THIS WARNING SIGN?

I for one spent most of my time trying not to stumble into one of our skeleton friends. If for some creepy reason the bones don't get ya, the maze of small slimy tunnels will.

These photos aren't great because it was pretty dark inside. But through the shadows one can see how some of the folks may have died.

I see the movers took the creative license to do some bone art. Heart (awww).

It's mesmerizing how densely they are stacked.

And then you pop out in this lovely neighborhood! Perfectly normal.

Phew.

Quick, must rebound by looking at some stereotypical French things.

I asked my Airbnb host who, originally from the UK, is now a wine seller in Paris what the French thought of California wines and he promptly responded, "They could spit on them." *Well excuuusez-moi...*

Wine cheese wine cheese wine cheese. Kay we're good now. 

I spent the morning before the catacombs at the Louvre. Or, I should say, at 1/100th of the Louvre.

Remember when I had the [this-museum-is-ginormous-FOMO-anxiety-slash-resignation](/2016/10/london-the-sights-churchill-war-rooms-british-museum/)? This time, I took some deep breaths, concentrated on hitting up a couple highlights, then settled into the Egyptian area.  

I might've seen this painting before somewhere.

If you ever have the chance to see Ms. Mona Lisa in person, take a second to turn around and look at the people looking at the painting because it's entertaining. From what I hear from others the crowd gets a lot worse than when I was there.

Stolen once, shame on you. Stolen twice, and these huge concrete doors will automatically slam down and trap you so don't even think about it.

Also take a moment to admire not only the masterpieces inside the Louvre but also the majesty of the grounds and buildings themselves. After all, it was a functioning palace!

The [winged goddess of Victory, Nike](http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/winged-victory-samothrace).

"No food" sign in France means no baguette. Tee hee.

I have always loved learning about all the Egyptian gods, maybe because they include a lot of animals. And hieroglyphics look so cool! Rosetta Stone, where are you when I need you?!

Mummifying does not stop at humans. Cat sarcophagi.

Fish.

Alligators?!

It must've been one of those "there was an old lady who swallowed a fly" situations. *Well now we gotta mummify a fish to feed the cat...*

And suddenly three hours had passed in the Louvre.

At the end of the full second day of sightseeing a traveler friend suggested a fancy macaron face-off. The competitors: [Pierre Herme](https://www.pierreherme.com/) and [Laduree](https://www.laduree.fr/en/#).

This cake is €100. GAH. Also how would you slice this? Horizontally? Rich people problems.
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-11-18-les-catacombes-le/32_expensive_cake.jpg' width='250'></p>

The macarons were about €3 each at both locations. I've never received a piece of jewelry much less food that was wrapped so extravagantly.

Both were yummy. Hey I'm a foodie, not an epicure...? 

I'm ashamed to admit that I did not eat any classic gourmet French food during my stay.

It was much too short!
