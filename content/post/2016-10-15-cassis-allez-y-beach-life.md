If pressed I'll say Barcelona was my favorite city of the whole trip, but that party town sure did me in. Cassis was the *perfect* respite as there's nothing sun, beach, and mountains can't heal in my book.

Fun fact: There were topless women at that beach! Go ahead, try to zoom in...

My flight from Barna to Marseille was about an hour and then I took a train from there. I didn't have a chance to venture into the city of Marseille; my first and main observation upon entering Le Midi was graffiti everywhere--inside and outside the trains, and all over the buildings outside.

The grunginess abruptly disappeared when I arrived at Cassis, a small, charming seaside town.

The Mediterranean vibe is strong and wonderful.

Bakeries are my favorite places on earth, so I was in paradise. I need to live in a city where a fresh baguette is within an arm's reach at all times.

My nice hostel host Anne-Marie described good hiking trails in the area and suggestions for my first afternoon, and after chatting for a bit with her in terrible half forgotten high school French, off I went. Cap Canaille or bust!

It was a bust.

Cap Canaille is a scenic point that is a two-ish hours' uphill hike from the city. I was wearing sandals, a dress, and my shoulder bag as opposed to backpack, and would learn later that I had also off-roaded onto the wrong trail. Gah.

Secretly, after a plane -> train -> bus morning I was not up for a longer trek anyways, so it felt fine to stretch my legs for a couple hours and enjoy fairly stunning penultimate views.

However, my curiosity was piqued and I could not leave without making it to the top. Fast-forwarding to day three, my last day in Cassis:

Wait, water isn't brown?

Meanwhile these thrill seekers on the side were giving me a semi heart attack the whole time.

Legs = rubber.

I took the long way back down the mountain.

"This is real life, this is real life..." was my mantra while sitting on the dock and watching the colors change. So much joy.
