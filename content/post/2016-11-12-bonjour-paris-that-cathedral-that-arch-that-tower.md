The chimeras know what's up.

To be honest, I was bracing myself to be disappointed by Paris because lesseee it's probably the most hyped up city in *the world*, but nope.

No disappointment here.

I took an evening train from Cassis to Paris, a two-ish hour ride on the [TGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV). Le Train a Grande Vitesse! Understand that on the outside it looked like I was just sleeping the whole ride, but on the inside I was nerding out about taking this high-speed rail. "Le Train a Grande Vitesse," I remember reciting repeatedly in French class. We certainly hummed along at ~250 km/h. So cool! No photos because sleeping, duh.

My tourist routine down pat by now, I started off the next day and new city with a [Sandeman's](http://www.neweuropetours.eu/paris/en/home) tour (I definitely recommend if you're in Europe!). 

Fun fact from our guide: the position of the horse feet in relatively modern equestrian statues tell you how their riders died. For example, if it's rearing, the rider died in battle; if all four feet are on the ground then the rider died of natural or non battle-related causes. Pont Neuf features the [Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France) statue on the left--he was assassinated, hence the semi-elevated stance perhaps.

Oh, and behind that statue:

Holy locks.

Standing above the water, you can't help but wonder if the veerry next lock will collapse the whole bridge. Tipping point, much?!

We walked through Le Louvre to the [Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe_du_Carrousel), a much smaller arc than the famous Arc de Triomphe (de l'Etoile). Our guide said that this arch was built because Napoleon needed a triumphant arch under which to return to Paris after his military victories while the Arc de Triomphe was still under construction.

The Eiffel Tower was built as the gateway for the 1889 World's Fair, not built to last. In the beginning, some hated and protested it for being ugly. To save it from being dismantled right after the Fair, Gustave Eiffel argued for its function as a radio tower. So besides being the most iconic tourist attraction in the world, that is what it is used for today! Annually, huge resources go into preserving the tower far beyond its intended lifetime, mainly preventing rust, but its decline is inevitable.

So French. I also liked how in general in France all the chairs on a cafe's outdoor patio would face the street, positioned like they were before a stage. People-watching is a serious hobby. I saw someone in a beret a second after this and I was like "YES I'm done."

After the tour, I returned to Notre-Dame Cathedral to explore inside. Notre-Dame is admired for its gothic architecture and was also the site of many significant events including the coronation of Napoleon.

After climbing a very tall, steep, spiral staircase, you understand why Paris is considered a most beautiful city. I'm officially jealous of a statue.

Hellooo down there!
![](/post/2016-11-12-bonjour-paris-that/14_notre_dame_ground.jpg)

I kept trying to pinpoint what made the city so alluring and I think it's in large part the light colored buildings and radial street layout.

Inside:

A confessional. So mod! Don't mind the oodles of tourists peering at you through the clear glass box.

After wandering around a bit and snacking on a cup of sorbet in the neighborhood of Notre-Dame, I took the subway to the Arc de Triomphe. Side note: Paris public transportation was the best in terms of bus and train frequency and map clarity.

The arch is in the middle of an especially large city circle and as jaywalking through an indeterminate number of lanes (it kind of seemed like a free-for-all once the lines disappeared) would be bonkers you take a tunnel to get to the building.   

There was a ceremony going on when I arrived.

[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe#Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier):

The Arc de Triomphe is actually a small museum with war-related exhibits, accessible via another long set of steep, spiral stairs that take you up a leg of the arch. But go for the view from the roof.

Magical dusk lighting is fine with me. The street on the right is [Champs-Elysees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es)!
![](/post/2016-11-12-bonjour-paris-that/25_arc_view2.jpg)

I want to go to there.

I distinctly remember having the stupidest grin plastered on my face as I walked through the darkening 
streets, toward the ultimate homing rod. 

Spaarrrkly O_O 
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-11-12-bonjour-paris-that/26_tower_sparkles.jpg' width='350'></p>
There was a fun light show every hour!

I stayed at the top for approximately 20 seconds because I was freezing by the time I got through the lines for tickets and elevators.

Though the chilly conditions were very real, there's still a little part of me that can't believe I was there.

Paris, nous t'aimons!
