Every morning in Cassis I awoke to a fresh baguette from Anne-Marie.

There was no question I was going for Le Tour de France mug too. It made me giddy to drink out of a Tour de France mug in France, I'm such a cheese ball.

Every morning I also greeted my animal friends. I spy a small white terrier!

That sweetheart would run up to me and jump on my legs with tail wagging. He belonged to the elderly lady in the home on the right (my hostel is the doorway on left). Also next door was a church whose clock tower dong-ed resoundingly every hour, *24 hours*. Fortunately the loud chimes didn't ever wake me up but the fact that they reverberated throughout the city 'round the clock was surprising. 

Different days, different cats. I was charmed by the relative sizes of them and this car. Monsterrr kitty!

My first full day in Cassis had to be dedicated to [Les Calanques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque), a beautiful national park that stretches between Marseille and Cassis. Let the hike begin!

A "calanque" is basically any inlet of the sea into land. They line the entire southern coast of France, but there are nine or so, of all different shapes and sizes, that are most popular and represent the park. The first one coming from the east, Calanque de Port-Miou, is a mere 30 minutes' walk from Cassis and serves as a neat creek harbor.

Incoming!

The cool thing about trails in the area is that they are all marked subtly by paint on rocks. It made navigating fun! I was following the red + white path mostly.

And there is no shortage of rocks! Crunch, crunch, I go on the gravelly paths.

The second calanque is another 30 minutes' walk in from Port-Miou. Calanque de Port-Pin allows swimming.

The clearest water I ever did see.

I felt a little like a creeper sitting in the shade and snacking (cookie-to-hiking ratio going strong, people) while watching because the French are so much more chillax about nudity. One man was standing among his friends and deck changing but didn't really care to put a towel around his waist so I was like woah unexpected butt. 

The water was calling to me, but I had my sights set on an even better pool. Onwards!

Hikers would toss a rock up on these little mountains to signify that they had reached this point in the hike.

The trail to the third and supposedly best calanque, Calanque d'En-Vau, is significantly more treacherous. After a steep climb up from Port-Pin, I was a little bit in denial that I had to go down this cliff. There's my gravelly white path down there...

I actually wandered over to a nearby outcropping in case there was an easier path. Biding my time, admiring the view.

Whelp. Here goes! I used my hands and feet to slide down. Just like the dogs!
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/post/2016-10-27-les-calanques/18_dog_hikers.jpg' width='350'></p>

Whew, finally flat land. Moseying our way through the canyon.

I couldn't relax entirely though because again, crazy brave rappellers. That kid up there is tiny.

After about another hour's hike in from Port-Pin, I was rewarded by the best calanque of them all!

Of course, \*angelic choir\*.

Time to bust out da beach towel! After 10 years of competitive swimming my deck changing skills are advanced, even if I do say so myself.

It felt *amazing* to swim in the crisp water and wash off dust and sweat. I met a French man out by the buoys who had lived for a while in the Bay Area and so we bobbed and chatted for a bit. 

As you can see, by the time I reached d'En-Vau the sun was mostly gone, so I quickly started shivering after coming out of the water and despite the generally warm weather started the long trek back bundled up in my jacket.

I packed a large water bottle but it really only lasted halfway, so I was happy to reach the city again. By the end of the day, I felt totally renewed. Woot nature! 

Major heart-eyes for this hostel.

Cassis is the most sweet and restful town and I will forever dream of its sunshine and easy vibes.

For now...it's onwards to the big city.
