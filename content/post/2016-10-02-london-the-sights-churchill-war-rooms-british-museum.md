Land of red telephone booths and double-decker buses!

Hey there, Big Ben!

I couldn't get over how intricate Big Ben is. Like, no matter how much you zoom in there are more detailed carvings and gold flourishes to discover.

On the other side of the bridge is the London Eye. And there's the Underground logo too! Check, check, check...

Don't even call yourself a city if [you don't have a](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKRB-JuBgIvCc1QzfyYbk5exwH_7Tbz0S8OAMs0/?taken-by=gu_amy) [spike](/2016/09/dublin-trinity-college-st.-patricks-cathedral-walking-around/).

Westminster Abbey is beautiful. Unfortunately, I didn't make it in for a visit since the first time I tried they were closed for a memorial and the second day, Wednesday, they are usually closed to tours. One tip though if you just want to see inside is to go watch the regular services for free.

Buckingham Palace! \*princess wave\*

Despite the whole monarchy thing, I found myself forgetting I was in a different country a lot of the time in London; big, worldly cities tend to be similar.

One of the highlights museum-wise were the Churchill War Rooms. This underground complex is where 
Churchill and team strategized for WWII. No one thunk that it was smack in the middle of London! Hiding in plain sight for reals.

I really do think all babies look like Winston Churchill.

I can't decide whether this is profound or not.

Leave it to me to focus not on his amazing military feats but rather his fabulous wardrobe. Purple suede onesie? *Work it.*

Okay here's the map room. Some of the most important decisions in the history of the world were probably made here, with furniture and papers perfectly preserved.

But look a decades-old doodle of Hitler in the middle of the ocean! Everyone needs a creative outlet, yeah?

"Let's just make a tunnel here for the tourists OHMYGAWD IT NEVER ENDS." Bombs, no thank you.

This room was staffed 24/7, and the people who worked here were responsible for keeping totally up to date with the war from multiple perspectives. Look at all those color-coded phones! Some of the phones were attached to big black boxes, scramblers. The tubes here are for shooting messages all around the complex.

The War Rooms are a huge construction and offer so much information. After several hours in there, I made it to the British Museum in the evening and did a speedy tour of its most popular artifacts.

Such as, the Rosetta Stone.

They just leave it out there and everyone can touch it. Just kidding, the original was enclosed in a case in a different room that I entered after my camera had died. 

I liked this guy. Hoa Hakananai'a, an [Easter Island statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#Statues).

The British Museum is seriously packed, overflowing with items. Walking through, it felt like one had to weave around ancient figurines and exhibits like one was in an absurdly successful archaeologist hoarder's house. I guess you acquire a bunch of cool stuff when you pretty much conquer the world...

The British Museum was so big, that I didn't even feel bad about being there for only an hour. I don't think it is humanly possible to see everything in there in less than one month (of living in the museum), which nudged me to the other extreme. 

Ancient telephone booth! ;)

My favorite tour of the trip so far covered in the next post--cheerio!
