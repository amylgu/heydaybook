Bangkok has all the Buddhas. You name it--pretty much any position and color combo. Our second day in Bangkok we spent touring its innumerable wats, or temples. 

First, we walked to the ferry stop to take a boat upstream to The Grand Palace, including Wat Phra Kaeo, or Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Holy wires!

As it was The Grand Palace, it was very crowded and a bit stressful with security. One of the toughest things about Thailand was having to wear long pants and sleeves in the sweltering heat to adhere to the dress code of the many religious tourist sites. Declan was one of the many tourists who had to buy pants beforing entering the grounds.

Once inside the sun dazzled blindingly off of all the gold!

We walked throughout the grounds, admiring the many sculptures and intricate designs, then took a lunch break. Mango and sticky rice in the homeland, woot!

Next we walked to Wat Pho, or Temple of the Reclining Buddha. They failed to add that it was a H.U.M.O.N.G.O.U.S. reclining Buddha (stranger's head there for scale).

I definitely underestimated the show-stopping effect of simply making an object gargantuan. There isn't anything intricate or amazing sculpturally about this Buddha--he's just so damn big. His feet.

Honestly, it can be easy to become numb to hundreds of Buddhas surrounding one every day in Thailand, so if you have to choose one temple to visit in Bangkok I would go to Wat Pho. Even if you know what to expect, somehow it's jaw-dropping to be in the presence of such a giant. 

Third up, we walked a longer distance to Wat Saket, or Temple of the Golden Mount. We sat on the benches under the overhang at the entrance for a few breaths to escape the sun before ascending the moderate stair climb, which led to a good view of the city.

At the base of the mount again, we decided to hitch a tuk tuk to the bustling Khaosan Road, also known as Backpackers Road, a short stretch of street where stalls, tourists, and knick-knacks abound. When in Thailand! The ride was as lawless and spastic as one might guess. Case in point: our driver lady was somehow watching a drama while weaving in and out of the busy traffic.

Wat Arun has a white and tiled aesthetic instead of dominantly gold.

Three cats :)

I was beat from the heat by the time we got off the ferry from Wat Arun. Mood:

I could write a whole blog post just on the animals of Thailand.

I don't know if it's the hustle and bustle of the nation but they are so full of character, from these fluffballs in Bangkok to the scrappy rescue animals who walk among giants, literally, in the countryside--where we are off to next.
