Here's a quiz for ya: Ireland, or the mooon?

We made a quick stop at [The Burren](http://www.burrennationalpark.ie/) during the long day tour of the west coast (best coast! :P) of Ireland that I took my third full day there.

County Clare is known for limestone. Everything was made out of rocks! The coolest being these endless walls that ran up all over the hills and divided plots of land (I actually didn't get great photos of them, but [here](https://edukalife.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/the-stone-walls-of-ireland-amazing.html) are some awesome ones).

Irish cottages, check! They look quite cozy in the rain.

Isn't the wall fantastic? I can't get over how they stack the stones so stably. No glue?!

To start at the beginning, though--the bus first paused along the road at a rest stop called Barack Obama Plaza.

What a celebrity. "There's no one as Irish as Barack O'Bama." *Actually*...

Although I will agree with you here (photo from back in Dublin).

Sorry, world. Moving on to not so nauseating topics...

<br>
Our first official stop was the [Cliffs of Moher](https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/).

So, these cliffs are legit, but...

as a spoiled Californian I daresay my home sweet Pacific Coast could give them a run for their money.

Okay, back to Ireland--I'm honestly more fascinated by how perpetually fluffy and green the grass is.

And how at every majestic tourist destination, when you turn around:

Always cows.

Because Cliffs of Moher = delicious.

Just don't.

Our final stop of the day was the lively coastal town of Galway.

It was a busy little cluster of shopping streets, but what was by far most remarkable were the talented street musicians! Like, every single one of them.

After purchasing some aran yarn and munching on some fried cod, I just stood around in the rain and enjoyed their awesome covers.
