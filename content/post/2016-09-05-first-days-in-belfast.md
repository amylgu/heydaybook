Belfast is amazing! Such a comfortable city. It's beautiful, lively but not too crowded, packed with restaurants, so walkable, diverse and tourist friendly. Admittedly, it doesn't take much to please me when I'm surrounded by the oh-so-musical Irish accent ;)

Super nice and gracious host Declan picked me up Sunday morning from BFS in a lil' red car and in no time we were at the popular [Maggie Mays](http://maggiemaysbelfastcafe.co.uk/). Of course, I had to inaugurate my trip with the traditional Irish full fry a.k.a ALL THE FRIED THINGS.

Soda bread! Potato bread! More potato! I'm really here! 

With plenty of meat and carbs to fuel us we proceeded on a long and in-depth walk throughout the city, hitting up the Botanical Garden, Queen's University, River Lagan, St. George's Market, the Allstate building (holla), hipster coffee shops, colorful murals in nooks, and everywhere in between.

I gained some confidence when Declan left temporarily and I made it to the grocery store, Tesco, and back without getting lost (too many times). 

My intense excitement successfully fighting off a powerful urge to sleep, I joined Declan and mother at stylish Acapulco in Ballyhackamore or "Ballysnackamore" (<- I have found my people) for a Mexican dinner. And then I came home and crashed. 

Monday was Labor Day in the States so I had the day to indulge my tourist self. I jumped on a [Hop On Hop Off](https://belfastcitysightseeing.com/hop-on-hop-off-bus-stops/) tour bus, which was a good way to get an overview of the city and strategize about what I want to do these next six weeks. It's already seeming like too short a trip!

There are peace walls and gates that the police can automatically open/close throughout the city, from a history of unrest including the Troubles. There is relative peace now, but the community is not ready to tear them down yet. Murals cover walls as well as the sides of businesses and residences alike, and the paintings update often.

There are different flags throughout the city. UK flags, Northern Ireland flags, 36th Ulster DIvision flags, and Ireland flags.

Never get tired of this view. The ever-majestic City Hall. Umm can we remodel ours to look like this?
