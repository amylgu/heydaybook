Gorgeous.

On my first full Sunday, I took a tour up to the unreal North Coast of Northern Ireland. The trip included Carrickfergus Castle, Dunluce Castle, the Giant's Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, and the Dark Hedges. 

Carrickfergus Castle.

Our bus driver/tour guide pointed out that the gray lump beyond the fog was Scotland! How cool. Helloo, over there!

Secret school caves along the freeway. I forgot the exact reason but our driver said teaching was outlawed at some point in this village, so teachers and students would meet secretly in these little nooks.

Dunluce Castle. Location, location, location.

The highlight of the day was definitely the [Giant's Causeway](http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/Giants-Causeway-Antrim-Northern-Ireland-Bushmills-P2800). Mindblowing.

It was extremely windy. I got knocked off balance by the wind multiple times! Every so often a combination of a large wave and gust of wind would send ocean spray into your face.

They're eeverywhere! :P

Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. Fishermen originally built a rope bridge on this ocean cliff to check on their salmon nets. The original bridge, with only one railing, has since been essentially replaced with a nice sturdy one for tourists.

Can't say I didn't feel a little bit shaky, though, scooching across the pass! Especially with those big gusts of wind.

Spoiler alert: I made it.

The last stop of the day was the Dark Hedges (cue squeal from Game of Thrones fans). I have to say, not being a GOT-er, sometimes the "sights" from that show were quite silly. "See that rock there? That was in season 2 episode 6..." But props to the NI tourism industry for milking it for all its worth. 

There is definitely some cinema magic involved in making these birch trees extra creepy, but they are cool.

The scenery the whole drive was breathtaking. The hills are fuh-reaking *alive*.

Heather colors the hills purple seasonally.

No dearth of livestock. Irish landscape, check!

I fell asleep counting (real) sheep on the drive home.
