My first Saturday here I dedicated to the main museums of Belfast. To facilitate my adventure, I put on a brave face and set out on Declan's teensy-bit-too-tall bike. Soon I was zipping all over the city!*

*Full disclosure: I actually did not move quickly at all due to frequent dismounts to check the map--on the way to the Crum a man was definitely walking uphill at a pace that averaged equal to mine, embarrassingly--but certainly getting lost/found happened faster and required less energy. 

First up, [Titanic Belfast](http://titanicbelfast.com/)!

Is it ironic that it looks kind of...like a iceberg? Anyways.

First, second, and third class. Third class still isn't bad!

Memorable facts:

* They tried to have a right-handed riveter and a left-handed riveter on each riveting team to be more efficient.
* The Titanic's bandleader, Wallace Hartley, is honored a lot for leading his musicians in playing music to calm passengers while the ship sank. All the musicians perished.

I also got to climb aboard the SS Nomadic, the Titanic's tender ship and last remaining ship of the White Star Line fleet.

Hehe.

Next to the Titanic museum is Titanic Studios, where media including Game of Thrones is filmed.

Passed the Big Fish (and people kissing the Big Fish) on the way to the Crum.

The very fortified [Crumlin Road Gaol](http://www.crumlinroadgaol.com/).

The whole experience is an hour-ish long tour, and was my favorite site of the day! Our tour guide Charlotte taught us all about the history of the Crum in a dramatic and entertaining way. It's weird to think about how it only stopped being used in 1996.

Beautiful old courthouse across the street from the jail.

The long tunnel from the jail directly to the courthouse. It was a busy route, with hundreds prisoners escorted back and forth every day. It used to have a cobblestone floor but prisoners kept unearthing the stones to throw at one another during fights so they had to replace them!

The first room that prisoners would be taken to upon admittance to the jail. Their specs would be taken, and they would have to put their clothes and belongings in one burlap sack, to be returned upon release, or never...

A prison guard. Get this: photographs were expensive back then, so they used a mirror to capture an individual's profile at the same time as his face. Two for one!

Original tiling. 170 years of wear and tear.

The circle, and nerve center of the jail. The building consists of four wings radiating out of this central location, where the admin could perch and peer down the different hallways of inmates. There were separate wings for men and women. But for some time, they put children in the same wings as the adults; after a tragic suicide by a 12-year-old boy, they began a safer policy of separating by age as well.

Another bad idea was the "silent" treatment. In the beginning, the Crum punished prisoners by cutting them off from any human interaction. Even in church (they provided both Catholic and Protestant services), prisoners would sit in different booths so they couldn't see one another. However, they began to realize that this isolation was driving people clinically insane.

Torture devices: a mop with an extremely heavy weight inside, just to make it harder; and a device to turn, around and around...there is a counter and screw on top to adjust the resistance.

Twelve hangings occurred at the Crum. "Fun" fact: When there were hangings, the community would go out and drink and rage. So, the day after hangings were always spent recovering. That's where the term "hangover" comes from!

The last room. Another "fun" fact: The device in the back was where prisoners were whipped; a multi-tailed whip called the cat was the most severe and feared punishment, after which even the most rebellious prisoners would not be so raucous anymore. That's where the term "cat got your tongue" comes from!

Now the Crum is a multipurpose venue, hosting concerts to even wedding receptions. Another tourist in my group made the excellent comment of it being appropriate, getting your life sentence here ;) Ho ho...

Thirdly, I rolled up to the Ulster Museum with just an hour left to explore inside. The Ulster Museum has all sorts of art and sculptures, but with little time to dawdle I spent the most time in the NI history section reading up on the complicated tensions that make the culture what it is today. It was a lot to absorb at the end of an info-filled day, but I am slowly learning more.
