Smoky mountains certainly set the scene at Glendalough, a city in County Wicklow known for its ancient monastic settlement.

Thousands of years ago, St. Kevin founded this place, which the tour guide described to us as a medieval university of sorts. Ancient Sather Gate (for the Berkeley folks)!

I cannot fathom how these inscriptions and structures have been here since the 6th century.

The cathedral. Proper cathedrals are supposed to face east.

To the right of the large window, there was a sink. This would be used to wash sacred vessels. For religious regions, this sink drains directly into the earth, rather than mix with other systems.

There were lots of grave slabs leaning up against the walls and laying on the ground inside the cathedral, and I tried to tiptoe around both them and the puddles formed by the ever-present and growing rain.

St. Kevin's Kitchen, though it is really another church.

From what I could tell, most of the graves were from the 20th century.

The doorways were so small! You can still discern inscriptions at the top of this doorway, too.

I saw a stag!

The monastic city connects to [Wicklow National Park](http://www.wicklowmountainsnationalpark.ie/). It had been pretty much downpouring the entire day, so the tour guide laughingly described the hike to the Upper Lake, but I wasn't going to let the weather stop me!

After a mere 20 minutes of walking...

WOW. Water, mountains, trees and my soul is so, so happy. 
I wanted badly to continue onto another trail that led to a waterfall, but alas had to abide by the tour bus' timeline so lingered around with my jaw dropped for a few more moments before grabbing a scone at the nearby food shack for the walk back (yes, my scone-to-hours-of-physical-activity ratio is 2:1).

The Lower Lake, right next to the monastic city.

Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains were actually the last stop of the day. On the way, we drove through the scenic [Wicklow Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_County_Wicklow) and the tiny town of [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_County_Wicklow)--they have their own sign! (cute)--though all my photos of these are terrible due to the bus speed and rain.

We first stopped at Kilkenny, a most medieval of Irish cities. Kilkenny Castle is a popular attraction.

From what I got there isn't much historical significance or interesting quirks about this castle, just a super rich people house.

Ladies back then liked to be pasty white and put on a bunch of makeup to achieve this; the boards on stands here are to shield their faces from the fire because otherwise the gunk would start to melt off their faces.

The bed is short not only because people were on average 5 cm shorter back then, but also because they believed that it was best to sleep propped up, not completely laying down. Funny!

Because rich people can have mono-functional household items, this mirror is specifically for checking that one's dress is of adequate length.

I liked all the yellow and black county colors and black cat mascots everywhere in the city. Apparently Kilkenny is crushing it in [hurling](/2016/09/dublin-trinity-college-st.-patricks-cathedral-walking-around/), so they have a lot to boast about.

I walked around the city, taking in all the stone castle-y structures turned into modern convenience stores and other businesses. 

The [Dunmore Caves](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186615-d525379-Reviews-Dunmore_Cave-County_Kilkenny.html) which look so fun to climb down into and explore are close to the city of Kilkenny, but I didn't get to go. Oh well, next trip to Europe :)
