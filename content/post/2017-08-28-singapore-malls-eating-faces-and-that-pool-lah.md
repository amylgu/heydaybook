First lesson of this trip: Singapore is fuh-reaking far. After a 10- and 7- hour flight with a layover in Tokyo in between, my nearly 24-hour travel effort landed me in this strange and tiny country. It felt like I had dropped into a whimsical man-made Dr. Seuss world, tropical island edition.

After regaining the use of my legs I managed to hop onto an early morning bus towards my first destination: Marina Bay Sands! I didn't know exactly which stop would be the correct one, but figured that I would notice when we approached the three-legged spaceship building so iconic in the Singapore skyline.

I would not be checking into this famous and luxurious hotel were it not for the enthusiasm of Declan--yep, you few readers will be graced by the misadventures of not one but two explorers this time! Apparently the strategy of making friends and future travel buddies by randomly emailing someone you've never spoken to 5,000 miles away and asking them to switch houses with you for a while works pretty well :)  

Eager for my first non-airplane/airport meal in about a full 24 hours, we wasted no time in checking things off the foodie list and decided to meet up at the revered Din Tai Fung in The Shoppes at Marina Bay. While Dex walked over from his hotel from the night before, I ducked into a lobby bathroom to change into a new outfit as I had gotten completely soaked walking the short 5-min stretch from the bus stop to MBS in the sudden downpours that happen here.

A small crowd had already started to form before it opened its doors at 10am, but it would be nowhere near as difficult to get in as in the States given that Din Tai Fung's are a rarity or nonexistent in our home cities and this little island has dozens. Supposedly DTF is better in Asia as well. I was clearly ravenous and preoccupied with catching up, since I did not take any photos of the assorted xiao long bao and small dishes we enjoyed. 

After eating and wandering we could check into our room and upon entering were immediately blown away by the view. Wowza!

So many ships! Singapore sure is different from the Europe aesthetic. I can best describe it as a futuristic rainforest alien city I mean country. We come in peace B)

Towel elephant. Adorbs.

After picking up our jaws off the ground, we engaged full-blown tourist mode and set off to hunt down the sites featured in Singapore's most popular social media videos. 

Check!

Due to adverse circumstances we actually ate at the Gudetama Cafe later that night. I would include a pic of my food but the depressed faces painted on my eggs actually creeped me out quite a bit and it was also very bad...

Moving on.

Oh yes we did.

Why drink a normal Americano when you can have one with your face on it? 

Sufficiently hot and wet now from walking in the humidity and rain, we turned back to the hotel and got psyched up for *the* thing.

Needless to be said, we were surrounded by selfie sticks and posing galore. It's really an admirable design, as once one swam to the edge one could see the layers below that allow for the epic visual.

I could almost feel the torrent of hashtags. 

Rejuvenated by the infinite waters and post disappointing aforementioned dinner, we navigated to the Supertree Grove for the second Garden Rhapsody show at 8:45pm. The attendants of the previous show one hour before were flowing out, and I felt like a salmon swimming upstream heading into the park. Even though it felt like no one else was going our direction, we joined a sizable community of tourists under the fake glen. 

The people laying on the ground, adorable babies, small dogs, and the gentle glow and sparkle of the trees created a relaxing atmosphere, despite the obvious artificial aspect of the grove. Once the clock struck 8:45pm, the lights started dancing to a cheesy medley of Broadway music.

I was surprisingly alert during the day despite the time change, but by the time the light show ended my eyelids were drooping. This time in the dominant outflow of people, we walked the 15 min back to the hotel and I could not help but fall asleep shortly after my head hit the pillow.

As someone who loves historical, ornate buildings and nature, I would've never chosen Singapore as a vacation destination myself. But it's easy to make the most of it while I'm here! It's such an interesting city/country, neither east nor west, the ultimate melting pot. Here are my observations so far on probable points of interest: 

* Is it clean? Yes, though not spotless. The lack of gum does result in noticeably fewer spots on the ground. 
* Immense diversity: you can see a church on one block, a mosque on the next, and a temple on the next! Unlike other Asian countries, being a native Singaporean says little about one's likely religious affiliation and heritage. The TV channels are in so many different languages and day-to-day signage requires so many lines of translations to accommodate the four official languages. As both an English and Chinese speaker, Singlish is so amusing!
* Life centers around the malls. It's where most of the restaurants and stores are, and there are tunnels and bridges that connect the numerous different shopping centers so one can move seamlessly from one to another.  
* AC is a wonderful thing. 

Now let's see if we can't cover every inch of this small country in the next two days.
