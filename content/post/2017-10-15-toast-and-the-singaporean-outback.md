The second morning in Singapore we packed up to leave our luxe lodgings at Marina Bay for a more economical hostel. But not before we took another dip in the infinity pool! We were determined to milk this once-in-a-lifetime reservation for all it was worth.

We decided to walk the 30 min or so to our hostel in Chinatown. Not a long distance at all, but walking anywhere in the intense heat and humidity always turns out to prove a challenge. We were both profusely sweating halfway there! I wonder if one can get acclimated to such heat; it is remarkable and funny to see the natives in this region wearing jeans and button-ups, the girls with full faces of makeup, without breaking a sweat while the foreigners huff and puff red-faced in short shorts and tank tops.

Based on a recommendation from Declan's friend, when we were almost at our hostel we stopped at Ya Kun Kaya Toast, a popular breakfast chain. We ordered two meal sets, which includes soft-boiled eggs, iced coffees, and the main feature of stacks of toast with the incredibly sweet spread that is kaya and loads--L-O-A-D-S--of butter, which was to be our downfall...

Summary of the meal:
 
[1st toast sandwiches]: Omg! This is so good! What a good sweet + salty combination. There is a lot of butter on the bread. 

[2nd toast sandwiches/half a stick of butter in]: I might puke.  

Shakily, we made our way to our hostel and wandered around the neighborhood, all the while hunting my phone that I was 95% sure I had lost/left at the cafe but due to communication hardships we did not retrieve successfully the first time backtracking. After Declan called it about a bazillion times, the Yakun staff finally picked up and said that we could come back to retrieve it! Thank goodness for travel buddies and Google's phone tracking functionality!

After the food and gadget setbacks, we proceeded to our scheduled programming. I very much wanted to do the Tree Top Walk and see monkeys, but after taxi-ing and hiking part way unfortunately the monkey part of the trail was closed that day (so many fails)! Our back-up nature plan was to go to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. 

Cool roots!

It was so amusing talking to native Singaporeans. The twenty-something guy in our uber pool on the way there exclaimed that he had never been to Sungeh Buloi because it was so far, a 20-30 min drive. Hah! These islanders had a totally different definition of "near" and "far." Count us as adventurous then.

Pretty, huh? I think I got about eight bug bites standing next to this stagnant water for approximately 20 seconds. Story of my life sigh.

Lizards!

We were still feeling a little queasy after our walk but decided that the right food might rejuvenate us, as it was almost dinner time by now and we had only eaten that fateful breakfast so many hours ago. 

We successfully took the MRT back to Chinatown and made our way to the famous Michelin starred [Hawker Chan's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/liao-fan-hawker-chan-singapore)!

A very explanatory title. Guess what we got...

A nice, simple, butter-free meal. Washed down by cold Tiger beers. 

By the time it got dark we had wandered to Merlion Park.

In time for the most epic light show ever. So dramatic. There were green beacons that swept across the sky and repeatedly honed in on that concrete knob in the middle of the water, all of course in time to crescendoing music. We were not prepared for this.

The above photo epitomizes Singapore for me. Though as dazzling as the UFO lights and majestic music were, they could not stop me from promptly falling asleep once we returned to the hostel. Time for a sleeping break, stomach and feet.
